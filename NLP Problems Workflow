For NLP, the preprocessing steps are comprised of the following tasks:

Tokenizing the string
Lowercasing
Removing stop words and punctuation
Stemming

training a Naive bayes model on our preprocess text:
preprocess the whole text data
compute freq(w, class)
compute P(w|pos) and compute P(w|neg)
compute lambda(w)
compute LogPrior = log( P(pos) / P(neg) )
